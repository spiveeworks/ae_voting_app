aesophia needs access to the sophia standard library in order to compile code.
It has its own way of fetching the standard library as part of its build
process, and then has this weird function
`filename:join([code:priv_dir(aesophia), "stdlib"])`
for finding the location of that standard library... but this location is
itself a symlink. In one sense this is a versatile setup with multiple points
of dynamism, but in another sense it is a multitude of dumb hacks stacked on
top of each other. I don't want to call into aesophia's rebar build process, so
I will just store these files straight in this repo, without a symlink, and
mimick the directory pattern that `code:priv_dir` is looking for.
